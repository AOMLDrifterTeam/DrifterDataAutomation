Current Phase: Phase 1
Overview
This repository contains the initial development of automated data scraping tools designed for the DrifterDataAutomation project. The primary objective at this stage is to establish a robust framework for 
scraping data from manufacturer-specific spec sheets, which are pivotal for the accurate aggregation and analysis of oceanographic data equipment.

Current Progress
We have initiated this project with the addition of two Python scripts: SIO_020.py and PG_102.py. These scripts are specifically tailored to scrape data from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and Pacific Gyre, 
respectively. They serve as foundational components for our scraping toolkit.
Comand to run: python SIO_020.py

Next Steps
The immediate goal is to enhance these initial scrapers to refine their data extraction capabilities. Following this, the plan is to expand our suite of scrapers to cover all relevant manufacturer spec sheets.

A centralized script will be developed to orchestrate these scrapers, enabling the automated execution based on the specific manufacturer of the spec sheet in question. This approach will facilitate the simultaneous 
scraping from a multitude of spec sheets, significantly streamlining the data collection process.

Final Goal
The ultimate aim for this phase is to automate the scraping of a wide array of manufacturer spec sheets through a single, unified command, thereby enhancing the efficiency and scalability of our data collection 
efforts in oceanographic research.
